# Silhouette metrics

## Summary


## Equation

$\frac{gg}{ff} s(i) = (b(i) - a(i)) / max(a(i), b(i))$

where a(i) is the average dissimilarity of point i to all other points in its cluster, and b(i) is the minimum average dissimilarity of point i to all points in any other cluster. The silhouette score for a clustering is the average of the silhouette scores for all data points.


## Description

Silhouette metrics are a family of measures used to evaluate the quality of clustering results. The silhouette score for a single data point measures how similar it is to its own cluster compared to other clusters. The silhouette score ranges from -1 to 1, where a score of 1 indicates that the data point is well-matched to its own cluster, while a score of -1 indicates that it is more similar to neighboring clusters.

A high silhouette score indicates that the clustering is appropriate, as data points are well-matched to their own cluster and dissimilar from other clusters. A low silhouette score suggests that the clustering is suboptimal, as data points are either poorly matched to their own cluster or too similar to neighboring clusters.

Different variations of the silhouette metric exist, such as the weighted silhouette and the silhouette coefficient. These variations adjust for issues such as unbalanced cluster sizes and differing densities between clusters. The silhouette metric is a useful tool for evaluating clustering results and comparing the performance of different clustering algorithms.

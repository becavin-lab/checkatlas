# Coefficient of Determination $R^2$

## Description 

The coefficient of determination, denoted as $R^2$, is a statistical measure used to assess the goodness of fit of a regression model.
It represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variables.
An $R^2 = 1$ indicates a perfect fit, while $R^2 = 0$ means the model explains none of the variability.  
Although commonly between 0 and 1, $R^2$ can be negative when the model fits the data worse than a horizontal mean line.
In bioinformatics, $R^2$ is often used to evaluate model performance in tasks like spatial transcriptomics or gene expression prediction.


## Formulas 

The standard formula for $R^2$ is :

$$
R^2 = 1 - \frac{SS_{\text{res}}}{SS_{\text{tot}}}
$$

Where : 

- $SS_{\text{res}} = \sum (y_i - \hat{y}_i)^2$ is the residual sum of squares (prediction errors),

- $SS_{\text{tot}} = \sum (y_i - \bar{y})^2$ is the total sum of squares (total variance),

- $y_i$ are the observed values,

- $\hat{y}_i$ are the predicted values,

- $\bar{y}$ is the mean of the observed values.

# Kruskal stress

Kruskal stress is a measure of the goodness of fit of a multidimensional
scaling (MDS) solution. MDS is a statistical technique used to represent the similarity or dissimilarity between a set of objects in a geometric space with a lower dimensionality than the original data. The Kruskal stress quantifies the amount of discrepancy between the distances in the MDS solution and the original pairwise distances. In other words, it measures how well the MDS solution represents the original data. The Kruskal stress value ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates a perfect fit and 1 indicates a very poor fit. The lower the Kruskal stress, the better the fit of the MDS solution.
